the ability to pause and make it so when your editing a video sound from other videos don't play","To remove a lot of glitches and bugs  E G  when I got to load a video from Xbox it takes ages to load and the video glitches out  Also when I\u2019m editing, implement a way so it\u2019s possible for users to add multiple effects on top of another effect, also just try to listen to all suggestions on the discord server ","Just decrease the amount of bugs and freezes, slowly add more features and it\u2019s all good :)","Maybe just look at all the bugs and add new stuff frequently, and listen to your community and have meetings with your top people to make big decisions","Transitions, miner glitch fixes such as music and screen shakes not staying when finished editing, ability to use own music from Spotify or YouTube or own clips, that\u2019s all I can think of currently but if I think of anything else I\u2019ll let you know","If Powder doesn\u2019t already, it would be nice to be able to save an edited video before you post it, like a regular video editing software ","Make it so instead of a phone number you can also do email","The things I noticed so far is that the app needs an undo button  The app also needs to allow to upload videos directly to YouTube by using the powder app on our phone  The app also needs a slow motion and speed up effect that also has an option to slow/speed the audio or not  Lastly, more video effects ","Nothing particular just like little things such as DM's , notifications , @ someone to respond   A subscribed feed of people u subscribed too etc   I'm sure that's all coming tho","To run a bit better on my phone since I have some crashes","I think you should add more editing options like slo-mo, different effects, etc  I do understand this app is new and not released yet but upon the release I think new editing features is something you should add ","When publishing clips, it should save your last edit just in case there was an error","take the background noise out so you can only hear the music on the clip","Well there is a bug where you are scrolling through videos and when you stop on a certain video multiple sounds of other creators videos play at the same time ","definitely try to speed up the process of creating the app for PC &amp; android (and yes i know it takes time to make the app but not everyone is on apple I0S)","I think Powder need slow motion and more ways to edit","be able to save your editing to finish it later, and keep it free and don't implant a \"pro\" version that give you more effects, etc   ","Fix the crash bugs","maybe put some tutorials because I did get lost in some bits","Like I said it\u2019s my first time on this AMAZING editing app so I gave no idea","When U upload your clip to try download it make it 10x faster it took me like 20m","the only issue i come across with editing apps is importing music, it always connects to apple music and not spotify so maybe figuring out a way to get music in there?","More bug fixes because it tends to crash often","Add more content, I can\u2019t really describe much besides customization to your profile (:","The effects and zoom, whenever I use the zoom, I use it to sync with the base for a better effect of music in my videos  But whenever I attempted this and posted a video it just completely cut it out of the video  Also, for the effect portion, I feel that there should be a range of how strong each effect should be, like a slide bar to show a range ","Well for one   add more effects    Fix the current bugs such as the shake and zoom feature not appearing when publishing the video  Another is with the zoom in feature allow the user to choose where they want the screen to zoom in instead of having it zoom in dead center  Also allow for users to import their own videos on top of the video and use their own music if possible   try to take things other editing apps have and use it   like KineMaster","Maybe make it so you can make your account private and you friends can only see what you post","Idk fix bugs i guess","there should be a dark and light mode with the automatic feature that came with iOS 13 (but light modes trash anyways dark iOS for the boiz) ","There are some editing bugs where it can't process stickers on my posts ","Probably make it on a pc version and allow so more function because the typing function is a little weird because you can only put a certain amount","Remove bug where the app closes sometimes when editing videos over a minute","I will completely transfer whenever you guys are able to release Powder gg for PC ","Definitely for sure somehow allow me to share PS4 clips to powder as right now I\u2019m getting it off my YouTube channel","Desktop or a better way to get clips from my Switch since I don't have Twitter","Add more game categories and promote them  Something for casuals (Ex: The Sims 4, Minecraft, Terraria), something for strategy gamers (Ex: Civ 6, Stellaris), something for simulations (Ex: Cities: Skylines, Euro/American Truck Simulator), something for retro gamers (Ex: Classic games, SNES, PlayStation One)  Currently the Powder app is mostly FPS games and Fortnite  To be the ultimate gaming app, it needs to appeal to a wider audience  I want to see Powder grow this way ","It\u2019s just a small change but you link your Xbox gamer tag or PS4 by typing in the username then it\u2019s locked instead of having to type it in everytime","I only have some things but maybe add a view count and limit how many reactions someone can put on a single post","To improve the powder app, I think you could spread your name a lot more  I only found you guys to an Instagram advert, so maybe advertising could be a step up?","Move it to PC and make it more able to edit full videos I guess I dont really know if it can cause all ive seen on the front page are clips and ive only edited clips","permanently sign people in to xbox live or other platforms instead if requesting a username every time","I can\u2019t click on the play button so to improve it you can just try to reduce the bugs ","Well i dont want to see peoples post i just want it to be an editor I could care less about some fortnite kid and the app crashes too much","You take your time and fix what you can, il not going to tell you what you should improve  because I know you\u2019re working hard on it  The app is extraordinary and has minimal problems  Just keep adding things and updating the app","Make it where highlight doesn\u2019t move you up the top posters list just think about it a kid makes one good clip and he jumps to top 3 what sense does that make","I would love if you could fix a bug where as soon as I save the finished clip to my camera role or post it on powder, the music is gone from the video  It\u2019s very frustrating ","Big Fixes Beacuse Mine crashes and I can\u2019t edit","Dont let us have to pay for the edits and stuff","The processing bug , can\u2019t upload anything I use an iPad","We need to remove people giving hateful comments to people who are trying their hardest  We also need people from getting false reactions just so they can rank up in the app","The only thing I could think of is reducing the amount of reactions one person can put on a single post","some of the video effects are not staying throughout the video","Not take as long to download big clips","Be able to edit longer videos than just 30 second clips ","Custom profile pic, more popular songs, cooler transitions","Adding edits that affect the graphics more than just an on screen effect ","Make the app have better transitions","maybe a new ui,and even small features that may seem unnecessary  but mainly more transitions at effects are needed","I think more transitions would be better and more sound effects","Adding more features and less bugs","Add more edit styles and cool effects","adding more editing options, like slow mo, easier music options ","Add more effects, make the interface more user friendly","Easier navigation","Add so u can slow it down or speed it up and put the download time very quicker","Maybe some more effects and filters that look cool :)","Honestly not much, some more unique effects would be cool","Better songs so songs that are for montages and songs from well known artists","Loading times faster more editing choices","Currently I feel like some of powders editing features need some adjustments and if improved would definitely improve my editing experience plus the experience of others as well","Better home screen","Longer clips","A less compact and more user-friendly interface with more features being rolled out continuously ","Better editing software","Make videos load faster","More options,
